**Data retrieving and pre-processing:**

- Hepatic RNA-seq (raw fastq files) of NAFLD cohort 1 (Govaere et al., 2020) and cohort 2 (Hoang et al., 2019) were retrieved from European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/) (Amid et al., 2020) under accession numbers SRP217231 (215 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients) and SRP197353 (78 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients), respectively; Hepatic RNA-seq of NAFLD cohort 3 (Azzu et al., 2021) with 58 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients were retrieved from the ArrayExpress data repository (Parkinson et al., 2005) under accession number E-MTAB-9815. Gene abundance in both transcripts per million (TPMs)) and raw count were quantified using the Kallisto (Bray et al., 2016) pipeline based on human genome (ensemble 102 version).

- Mouse transcriptome data was uploaed to GEO database with accession number:[GSE184019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE184019)
